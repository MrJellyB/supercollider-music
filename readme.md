## SuperCollider Music
Various pieces that I've cobbled together in SuperCollider. Some of these are more musical than others, and they're all organized by how I feel about them.

- `musical`: Pieces that are more musical than anything.
  - `alright`: Pieces that I don't care for too much.
  - `good`: Pieces that I think aren't too bad.
  - `great`: Pieces that I actually enjoy listening to.
  - `promising`: Pieces that I think could turn out really well with some more work.
  - `experiments`: Pieces that were more experiments than actual attempts at music.
  - `failures`: Pieces that just did not come out right.
  - `senior project`: Pieces I composed for my high school senior project. These are my first pieces.
- `sounds`: Files that contain sound effects more than music.
- `synths`: Various synths I've programmed or found.
- `samples`: Audio samples for granular synthesis.
